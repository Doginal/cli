Vision Statement
----------------

We believe it is now possible to create Artificial Intelligence, Deep Mining and Machine Learning
sandbox where contributions and discoveries can be shared, experimented with and adopted by other
projects without effort. In order to do that, a unified environment must exist. Not only for basic
computing infrastructure, but also for dealing with surrounding efforts including management of deployments,
scaling, queueing, distribution of persistent state.

Madcore Project unifies selection of providers and open source projects to provide familiar experience.
We can only dedicate our resources to a very narrow selection, however it is our community that eventually
makes these decisions.
